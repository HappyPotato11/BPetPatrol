# PetPatrol

Submission for HackCMU 2019
Team: Isabel G., Megha K., Ihita M.

Developed with: Android Studio, Firebase Cloud Storage, Firebase Realtime Database

PetPatrol relies on the community to help find lost pets. Those who have lost pets submit a profile (including a picture) of 
their pet to the app, which stores it in Firebase. Those who find pets can submit a profile on the app, which compares that
submission with profiles of lost pets in the app. If a lost pet is found, the owner is contacted.

Not yet implemented: email/phone number, bug with image display
